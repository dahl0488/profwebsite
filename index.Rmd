I research school and community-based interventions that support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to participate in communities of their choice. My research line focuses on self-determination and interventions that support adolescents with disabilities to learn to read. 

I am a Researcher at the Institute on Community Integration and a PhD student in Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota. I love bikepacking and planning the next trip.
